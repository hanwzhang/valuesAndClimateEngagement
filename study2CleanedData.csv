Once my daughter was born, I realized how important it was to care for the world my daughter will inherit. I don’t want her to inherit a world where the fish are dying in oceans because of global warming or where micro plastics contaminate her water. I want her to grow up into a world where people care about their planet.",109.9,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,3,1.8,4,6,5,3,4.5,NA,NA,NA,"65,49,67","85,49,81,65,25,47,65","67,85,25,49","63,65,23,65,41,61","27,61,27,67","25,41,41,61",YesYesYesYesYes,5,5,4,4,5,4.5,2,1,NA,White or Caucasian,NA,No,6,0,75035,Independent,NA,3,0,6,low ST × high SE,1,0,liberal

If I do not have class, I may go to a dance or indoor cycling class which typically last about an hour. After either school or exercise, I come home and walk my dog for about 20-30 minutes. Afterwards, I eat dinner and watch either the news or a TV show on my phone for about 30 minutes to an hour. Before I go to sleep I may call a friend or relative for about 20 minutes to 30 minutes. I try to pray for meditate for a few minutes before I fall asleep, but it doesn't always work out that way. On weekends, I may do similar activities in the evening, or I may go out with friends or family. However, once I get home my routine is pretty similar (walking my dog, etc.).
